## Best Courses \(Ordered by How I Completed Them\)

Even without the first group of CompTIA certifications I got, I believe the resources within my notebook is more than enough to pass without any prior experience

Make sure you study each resource thoroughly so you can actually absorb all the information. I recommend writing them down because your brain will remember things easier that way!

* A+, Net+, Security+, Pentest+, CySA+ Certifications \(I do not think this is necessary\) 
* [The Cyber Mentor's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLKT__MCUeiwBa7d7F_vN1GUwz_2TmVQj) free Youtube playlist
* [IppSec's](https://www.youtube.com/c/ippsec/videos) videos over Hack the Box
* [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/DarthPwn) \(check the link to look at all the 98 rooms I completed before moving on to the next step, going this overkill is not necessary\)
* [Ethical Hacking with Metasploit: Exploit & Post Exploit](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethical-hacking-with-metasploit-exploit-post-exploit/) \(not necessary\)
* [Metasploit Unleashed](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/)
* [Open-Source Intelligence \(OSINT\) Fundamentals](https://www.udemy.com/course/osint-fundamentals/) \(not necessary\)
* [Linux Privilege Escalation for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-privilege-escalation-for-beginners/)
* [Linux Privilege Escalation for OSCP & Beyond!](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-privilege-escalation/)
* [Windows Privilege Escalation for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/windows-privilege-escalation-for-beginners/)
* [Windows Privilege Escalation for OSCP & Beyond!](https://www.udemy.com/course/windows-privilege-escalation/)
* [Virtual Hacking Labs](https://www.virtualhackinglabs.com/) \(can be skipped if it is outside of the budget, but it is highly recommended\)
* [Proving Grounds Practice](https://www.offensive-security.com/labs/individual/)
* Finally, after all of this preparation, the OSCP was purchased
